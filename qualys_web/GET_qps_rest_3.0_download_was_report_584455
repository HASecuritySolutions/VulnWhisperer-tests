version: 2.0.2
script uri: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js

Details:
CVE-2015-9251: jQuery versions on or above 1.4.0 and below 1.12.0 (version 1.12.3 and above but below 3.0.0-beta1 as well) are vulnerable to XSS via 3rd party text/javascript responses(3rd party CORS request may execute). (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432).
Solution: jQuery version 3.0.0 has been released to address the issue (http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/08/jquery-2-2-and-1-12-released/). Please refer to vendor documentation (https://blog.jquery.com/) for the latest security updates.

----------------------------------------------

In jQuery versions on or above 1.12.2 and below 2.2.0 $.parseHTML has (lots of) XSS. In these versions parseHTML() executes scripts in event handlers. Please refer following resource for more details: https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11974, http://research.insecurelabs.org/jquery/test/

"QID","45017","Operating System Detected","Information Gathered","2","","","","",,,"Several different techniques can be used to identify the operating system (OS) running on a host. A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
<P>
1) <B>TCP/IP Fingerprint</B>: The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
<P>
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
<P>
2) <B>NetBIOS</B>: Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
<P>
3) <B>PHP Info</B>: PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
<P>
4) <B>SNMP</B>: The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.

The Host Scan Time does not have a direct correlation to the Duration time as displayed in the Report Summary section of a scan results report. The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

For example, a Web application might include the user's name as part of a welcome message or display a home address when confirming a shipping destination. If the user-supplied data contain characters that are interpreted as part of an HTML element instead of literal text, then an attacker can modify the HTML that is received by the victim's Web browser.
<P>
The XSS payload is echoed in HTML document returned by the request. An XSS payload may consist of HTML, JavaScript or other content that will be rendered by the browser. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would need to trick a victim into visiting the URL with the XSS payload.","XSS exploits pose a significant threat to a Web application, its users and user data. XSS exploits target the users of a Web application rather than the Web application itself. An exploit can lead to theft of the user's credentials and personal or financial information. Complex exploits and attack scenarios are possible via XSS because it enables an attacker to execute dynamic code. Consequently, any capability or feature available to the Web browser (for example HTML, JavaScript, Flash and Java applets) can be used to as a part of a compromise.","Filter all data collected from the client including user-supplied content and browser content such as Referrer and User-Agent headers.

"QID","150012","Blind SQL Injection","Confirmed Vulnerability","5","SQL","A1","WASC-19","CWE-89","9.3","6.8","<P>Blind SQL injection is a specialized type of SQL injection that enables an attacker to modify the syntax of a SQL query in order to retrieve, corrupt or delete data. A successful exploit manipulates query criteria in a manner that affects the query's logic. The typical causes of this vulnerability are lack of input validation and insecure construction of the SQL query.
</P>
<P>Queries created by concatenating strings with SQL syntax and user-supplied data are prone to this vulnerability. When any part of the string concatenation can be modified, an attacker has the ability to change the meaning of the query.
</P>
<P>Typical detection techniques for SQL injection vulnerabilities use a payload that attempts to produce an error response from the web application. Detection based on blind SQL injection uses inference based on the differences among the application's responses to various payloads. Blind SQL does not rely on error messages, which is beneficial when testing web applications that trap errors.
</P>
<P><B>How It Works:</B><BR>
The WAS scanning engine uses a well known methodology called <I>""True and False""</I> inference to determine if there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Basically, it uses two payloads: one with a 
<I>""True condition""</I> and another with a <I>""False condition""</I>. If there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability, the query with the 
""True condition"" payload will cause the web application to return a different response than the 
""False condition"". 
</P>
A good example of a ""True condition"" payload would be <B>' AND 1=1</B>. Since 1 always equals 1, the condition is true. An example of a ""False condition"" payload would be <B>' AND 1=2</B>. Since 1 does not equal 2, the condition is false.
<P>
For example, let's say there is a web application with a textbox that searches for customer names and displays the results inside a table. And let's assume that if someone searches for John there is one result only. When scanning for the blind SQL injection vulnerability, the WAS scanning engine uses two payloads:</P>
- <U>True condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John' AND 1=1</B> to issue the query
	<I>""return John only if 1=1""</I>. Since 1 always equals 1 the condition is true. The result is John, which is the same result as using the string John.
<P>
- <U>False condition payload</U>: This injects the string <B>John' AND 1=2</B> to issue the query
	<I>""return John only if 1=2""</I>. Since 1 is never equal to 2, the condition is false. The result is nothing or ""No results found"".
<P>
With the results from the two payloads, the WAS scanning engine draws the conclusion that there is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. Even though there is no one called 
<I>""John' AND 1=1""</I> in the database, web application displays information for ""John"" if a search is done with that query string.</P>
<P>
<B>Example:</B><BR>
These few lines demonstrate an insecure query that is created by appending user-supplied data (<B>name</B>):
</P>
<CODE>
On Error Resume Next ' Page traps error and do not display it<BR>
Set oRSu = oCONv.Execute(""SELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name = '"" &amp; Request(""txtSearch"") &amp; ""'"")<BR>
If oRSu.BOF Or Err.Number <> 0 Then<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response.Write ""No results found!""<BR>
End If
</CODE>
<P>
If no checks are performed against the name parameter, then the query may be arbitrarily modified and sent to database as shown in these two examples of a completed query:
</P>
<CODE>
SELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name='<B>John' AND 1=1</B> <BR>
SELECT fname, name FROM customers WHERE name= 'John'; SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT
</CODE>
<P>In the first case the database will return <I>""John""</I> since the condition <B>AND 1=1</B> is always true.","The scope of a SQL injection exploit varies greatly. If any SQL statement can be injected into the query, then the attacker has the equivalent access of a database administrator. This access could lead to theft of data, malicious corruption of data, or deletion of data.","SQL injection vulnerabilities can be addressed in three areas: input validation, query creation, and database security.
<P>
All input received from the web client should be validated for correct content. If a value's type or content range is known beforehand, then stricter filters should be applied. For example, an email address should be in a specific format and only contain characters that make it a valid address; or numeric fields like a USA zip code should be limited to five digit values.
<P>
Prepared statements (sometimes referred to as parameterized statements) provide strong protection from SQL injection. Prepared statements are precompiled SQL queries whose parameters can be modified when the query is executed. Prepared statements enforce the logic of the query and will fail if the query cannot be compiled correctly. Programming languages that support prepared statements provide specific functions for creating queries. These functions are more secure than string concatenation for assigning user-supplied data to a query.
<P>
Stored procedures are precompiled queries that reside in the database. Like prepared statements, they also enforce separation of query data and logic. SQL statements that call stored procedures should not be created via string concatenation, otherwise their security benefits are negated.
<P>
SQL injection exploits can be mitigated by the use of Access Control Lists or role-based access within the database. For example, a read-only account would prevent an attacker from modifying data, but would not prevent the user from viewing unauthorized data. Table and row-based access controls potentially minimize the scope of a compromise, but they do not prevent exploits.
<P>

For example, a Web application might include the user's name as part of a welcome message or display a home address when confirming a shipping destination. If the user-supplied data contains characters that are interpreted as part of an HTML element instead of literal text, then an attacker can modify the HTML that is received by the victim's Web browser.
<P>
The XSS payload is echoed in the HTML document returned by the request. An XSS payload may consist of HTML, JavaScript or other content that will be rendered by the browser. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would need to trick a victim into visiting the URL with the XSS payload.
<P>
Note! This specific test uses an XSS payload that takes advantage of Mozilla's HTML parsing engine. Manual confirmation of this vulnerability should use the Mozilla browser. Even though this exploits a particular Web browser, the Web application still has inadequate input filters.","XSS exploits pose a significant threat to a Web application, its users and user data. XSS exploits target the users of a Web application rather than the Web application itself. An exploit can lead to theft of the user's credentials and personal or financial information. Complex exploits and attack scenarios are possible via XSS because it enables an attacker to execute dynamic code in the victim's Web browser. Consequently, any capability or feature available to the Web browser (for example HTML, JavaScript, Flash, and Java applets) can be used as part of a compromise.","Filter all data collected from the client including user-supplied content and browser content such as Referrer and User-Agent headers.

This is an application-level DoS that consumes server resources by maintaining open connections for an extended period of time by slowly sending traffic to the server.

The attack holds server connections open by sending properly crafted HTTP POST headers that contain a Content-Length header with a large value to inform the web server how much of data to expect. After the HTTP POST headers are fully sent, the HTTP POST message body is sent at slow speeds to prolong the completion of the connection and lock up server resources.

","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.
<BR>
<BR>
The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.

"Category","Severity","Level","Description"
"Confirmed Vulnerability","1","Minimal","Basic information disclosure (e.g. web server type, programming language) might enable intruders to discover other vulnerabilities, but lack of this information does not make the vulnerability harder to find."
"Confirmed Vulnerability","2","Medium","Intruders may be able to collect sensitive information about the application platform, such as the precise version of software used. With this information, intruders can easily exploit known vulnerabilities specific to software versions. Other types of sensitive information might disclose a few lines of source code or hidden directories."
"Confirmed Vulnerability","3","Serious","Vulnerabilities at this level typically disclose security-related information that could result in misuse or an exploit. Examples include source code disclosure or transmitting authentication credentials over non-encrypted channels."
"Confirmed Vulnerability","4","Critical","Intruders can exploit the vulnerability to gain highly sensitive content or affect other users of the web application. Examples include certain types of cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks."
"Confirmed Vulnerability","5","Urgent","Intruders can exploit the vulnerability to compromise the web application's data store, obtain information from other users' accounts, or obtain command execution on a host in the web application's architecture."
"Potential Vulnerability","1","Minimal","Presence of this vulnerability is indicative of basic information disclosure (e.g. web server type, programming language) and might enable intruders to discover other vulnerabilities. For example in this scenario, information such as web server type, programming language, passwords or file path references can be disclosed."
"Potential Vulnerability","2","Medium","Presence of this vulnerability is indicative of basic information disclosure (e.g. web server type, programming language) and might enable intruders to discover other vulnerabilities. For example version of software or session data can be disclosed, which could be used to exploit."
"Potential Vulnerability","3","Serious","Presence of this vulnerability might give access to security-related information to intruders who are bound to misuse or exploit. Examples of what could happen if this vulnerability was exploited include bringing down the server or causing hindrance to the regular service."
"Potential Vulnerability","4","Critical","Presence of this vulnerability might give intruders the ability to gain highly sensitive content or affect other users of the web application."
"Potential Vulnerability","5","Urgent","Presence of this vulnerability might enable intruders to compromise the web application's data store, obtain information from other users' accounts, or obtain command execution on a host in the web application's architecture. For example in this scenario, the web application users can potentially be targeted if the application is exploited."
